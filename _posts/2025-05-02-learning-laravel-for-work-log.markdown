## Work Log

I have begun development of [Work Log](https://github.com/eyanje/work-log) in
Laravel. It has been a while since I wrote code without understanding the
framework, so development will likely be slow.

Completed tasks

1. Initialized the project using Laravel's Vue template.
2. Created a nonfunctioning page to display a logbook.

Upcoming tasks

1. Implement Book and Record models in the backend.
2. Store and retrieve new Records in the Book controller.
3. Manually test a user's ability to write new entries.

## Open source

I intend to research Tokio and understand how it waits for readiness. Hopefully
this can uncover important details about my bug.
