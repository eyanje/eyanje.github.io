## Work Log

### Imports

Work Log now supports importing an iCalendar file, so it is possible to download
a book as a backup. However, this feature isn't stable yet. The backup form is a
single part of the settings page without any confirmation, so it also needs
work, but it's functional.

### Branding

I'm also working on a name and logo. I'm starting with the logo because I don't
have any clever names, and it's easier to make an abstract logo than an abstract
name. I want to convey the idea of simple, self-directed time management, but I
want to avoid making the design too generic.

### Next week

I aim to finish branding and deploy my project locally next week. In the past, I
have only deployed projects manually, but I should be able to implement a simple
automated solution by the end of the week.
