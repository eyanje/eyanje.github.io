title: Work Log has branding

Work log now has a name and logo, and the Laravel branding is mostly absent.
I've decided to just name it "Journal" and use one of the early versions of the
logo.

## Next week

Last week, I discussed using Jenkins to automate the test, build, and deploy
cycle, but I had issues integrating with Docker Compose. I'm currently
researching Kubernetes to handle building and deploying the application.
Kubernetes seems more automated, so hopefully I don't need to manually restart
services.
