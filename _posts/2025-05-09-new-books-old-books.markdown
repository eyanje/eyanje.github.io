## Work Log

Work Log now supports the creation, modification, and deletion of books.

### Remaining tasks

There is little work remaining before the product becomes usable. However, there
remains much work before the product is complete.

Critical issues:
* No dates are shown.
* Sidebar is not customizable.
* Passwords are not salted.

Moderate issues:
* The dashboard is still empty.
* Project lacks branding assets.

## Open source

No progress yet. I must still research Tokio's readiness mechanisms.

## Next week

Next week, I will be on break, so I don't expect to do any work.
