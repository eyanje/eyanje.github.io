I will resume development on the bluetooth HID device server to enable usage within systemd. The following tasks remain:

1. Select a suitable directory to put sockets.
2. Write a systemd script to run the central server.
3. Write an additional script to enable advertising specific profiles.

I plan to document my progress on this blog, at least once per week.
