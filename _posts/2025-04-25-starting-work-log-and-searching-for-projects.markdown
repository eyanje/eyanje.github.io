## New project: Work Log

I'll be starting a new project, currently named Work Log. As the name suggests,
it helps the user log their work to improve their productivity. I'm aiming to
ship something in two to three weeks.

I meant to make this project a while ago, but I couldn't decide on a
satisfactory design. This time, I'll use a more agile development strategy to
build faster and discover flaws sooner. Since I'm the first user, I can begin
development immediately. Over time, I hope to learn about the challenges of
making an application like this.

### This week's goals

This week, I aim to put the project on GitHub. This involves learning a bit
about Laravel, enough to initialize the project correctly. After putting the
project on GitHub, I'll be able to track issues more easily.

## Open source

This week, I searched for more open source projects, but I have yet to find a
good fit with project size, level of activity, and hardware requirements.
