## Work Log

Bookmarking and exporting books are now enabled.

A book with a bookmark appears in the sidebar. Books are bookmarked when
created, but the bookmark can be removed. To access unbookmarked books, we
provide a library, which replaces the dashboard page.

Books can now be exported as iCalendar files, so the data can now be backed up
to secondary sources. However, the data cannot yet be reimported, and the
exported data doesn't remember its book.

### Remaining tasks

* Data cannot be imported.
* Passwords are not salted.
* Project lacks branding.

## Next week

I plant to polish importing and exporting so that data can be backed up
completely.
